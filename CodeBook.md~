#Study Design
As stated in the features_info.txt file provided with the data:

"The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). "

"These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions."

The following measurements were estimated from this data:
*tBodyAcc-XYZ
*tGravityAcc-XYZ
*tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
*tBodyGyro-XYZ
*tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
*tBodyAccMag
*tGravityAccMag
*tBodyAccJerkMag
*tBodyGyroMag
*tBodyGyroJerkMag
*fBodyAcc-XYZ
*fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
*fBodyGyro-XYZ
*fBodyAccMag
*fBodyAccJerkMag
*fBodyGyroMag
*fBodyGyroJerkMag"

From these measurements, the mean value and standard deviation were chosen to be included as variables in this dataset, resulting in 86 variables

#Data Summary Methods
The data were summarized by taking the average of each variable by both study participant and activity factors. The units were not clear in the original dataset, but have not been changed in the processing to create the tidy dataset.
